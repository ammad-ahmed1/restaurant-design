- inline css
- internal css
- external css

Inline css has the most priority.
If you are using external or internal css then add inline css, inline css style will work
If you are using different properties in different css ways, all will work
If clash comes, inline css will get the importance.
If important is only used in external css,only that will run.

-Selectors

Helps to target the elements we want to style
- element selector
- id selector
- class selector
- grouping selector

Element selector will give style to all elements
i.e 

p{color: red;} 

It will make all paragarphs in project color red

Id selector is used when you want to give style to only one object.
It can't be used for any other object

Grouping selector means giving style to multiple elements

ie

div, span{
background-color: red;
}

-Fonts

-Web Safe fonts: Are preinstalled in OS
-Web fonts: Are not installed already, we install them

-We can stack the fonts
p{
 font-family: Sans-serif, Arial, Calibri;  
}
Now it will first check Sans-serif, if it is available will use it otherwise
it will check arial and so on....

-Line height: The spacing between fonts
